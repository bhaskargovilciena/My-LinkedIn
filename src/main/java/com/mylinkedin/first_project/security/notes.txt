we can set custom username n password in application.properties
1. spring.security.user.name=bhaskar
2. spring.security.user.password=bhaskar@1

SecurityFilterChain: creating custom filters for incoming requests and creating a chain of such filters
filter will see whether incoming req is a part of its acceptance criteria or not. if yes, then it will perform the ops on that request and pass to next filters.

we use a UserDetailsService which is used to create some default users and assign them role. we return InMemoryUserDetailsManager object in this function
when passing password remember to encode the password using a password encoder typically a BCryptPasswordEncoder

INTERNAL WORKING OF SPRING SECURITY
req comes to ServletFilterChain and does some basic checking like checking request headers etc
when using SpringSecurity then SecurityFilterChain will also be added in the middle. multiple filter created here by the coder to secure endpoints

at the start of a filter, that filter checks whether the req is authenticated by a previous filter. if yes, then just carried forward. else, processed.

the scheme is:
ServletFilterChain -> SecurityFilterChain = multiple filters which are processed one by one -> SecurityContext =  sets the context of current user, its roles, details etc
                              |
                              v
                      AuthenticationManager = tells the service to authenticate this request with any of the methods
                              |
                              v
                      AuthenticationService = authenticates using any of the method. like for eg: DaoAuthentication uses username (passed in UserDetailsService) and password (passed in PasswordEncoder), OAuth uses oauth when the user tries to login using oauth method


JWT CREATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
JWT = json web token: a token that is used to verify the user. it contains some basic details that may be seen by other but it also has a signature that is used to confirm that this token was generated by the server and this user can be validated.
the server validates all 3 things: header, user details and signature (unique to server) and if validates then accepts else rejects

we create a custom user details service in order to match the default user and the user stored in the database.
